										<blockquote>
											<p><em>
												This course has introduced me to fundamental concept of mathemathics and Computer Science. The knowledge I learned from set theory, probabilities and combination, graph theory and finite automata were very insightful. This topics enhanced my problem solving skills in real-world by using reccurance relations and graph theory, deepened my understanding in the technological world. In addition, the most challenging yet rewarding aspect was mastering the mathematical proof which I found it too difficult in my initial days but with a lot of practices and guidance from the lecture, I learned some of the key steps in solving those problems.

											On 20th of October 2024 , our Technology and Information System subject had a PC Maintenance Workshop and we all had been taught to assemble PC step-by-step with guidance of experts.  The guide's instructions was crystal clear and that's the main reason we did our lab session perfectly without any mistakes. We learned the correct way of fixing the components into their places and connecting wires to ensure the PC functioned  well. We had a great time learning at this workshop and it was an amazing experience for me.

										  <p><em>
											Recently, my peers and I attended an industrial talk which is given by the ex-CTO Clarity Techworks and the employees of the Clarity Techworks. Their talk was really influential and thought-provoking as it contains a lot of things that we needed to master before we step in to our career in the future. They taught about the Job Scope, Technology they used, skills that needed to enter this competitive field and many more about technologies. Personally, i have learned a lot about the mindset of the company in choosing their employees. For instance, I would say that companies tend to hire those with a good character and discipline rather than taking those with higher marks but with no integrity. This is what has been said by their ex-CTO and deep down it really make sense! This is because skill can be learned anytime as time goes by but a good character should comes from their heart naturally.

												In the aftermath of the visit to UTM Digital, I gained more significant knowledge about the workspace environment in this field which is highly organized. Personally, I felt that the environment itself shows the efficiency of their work which got me intrigued to work in this field after my graduation. This visit definitely opened my mind to learn more skills that are needed in this field to ensure I got a good position in the future. Furthermore, UTM Digital proves that teamwork is something that drives them to achieve more success. In addition, UTM Digital space such as smart board meeting room, open office and digital multipurpose area were very advanced and well maintained. Last but not the least, the UTM Digital staffs were really down to earth and also very knowledgeable especially the one who we interviewed, En Fairuz. His reply to each question of us screams the experience he had in this field and left us stunned.

										<p><em>
											In my interpretation, this talk made me realize the necessity of improving technical skills which includes analytic, problem solving and programming skills. This can be attained by enhancing proficiency in various programming languages such as C++, Python and Java. Although many other languages still exist and need to learn later, I believe that this programming languages are widely used nowadays in this fastly evolving industry. Furthermore, I trust that by engaging in activities that related to career-building will surely contribute to my future job in this industry. This is because participation in career related activities and competitions can expand my experience and also improving my social skills. Mainly, in these four years of my bachelorâ€™s program, I aim to master all the subjects such as database, network communication and data structure to pursue my dream in becoming a successful data analyst. I will commit myself by investing my best efforts in improving my skills that necessary to be a professional in this technology field.

												In my view, programming language has been the toughest yet most interesting course as it requires patience, logic and creativity to solve problem. As a beginner, the struggles I faced was so overwhelming , but then I learned a lot of skills through lecture notes, lab exercises, assignments and even YouTube videos, which played a significant role in helping me understand some crucial topics. Furthermore, the debugging was quite frustrating yet it is the most important part of learning because each mistake will teaches me a lesson which I will carry for the rest of my programming journey. I acknowledge that writing efficient code is just as important as making it work because my goal is not just about making some random outputs but to develop meaningful solutions, especially bioinformatics. The medical field requires technological advancements to enhance our healthcare system. I hope I will achieve my goal in the future with all my dedication, efforts and perseverance.
